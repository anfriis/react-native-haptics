## üì±üëà Haptic types

Through the constant ``` HapticsType ``` we provide different types of haptics. You can read more about the different types and how they should be used.

| Haptics Type        	|                                                                                                                                 Usage                                                                                                                                	|
|---------------------	|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:	|
| selection           	| Selection. Indicates that the selection is actively changing. For example, the user feels light taps while scrolling a picker wheel. This feedback is intended for communicating movement through a series of discrete values, not making or confirming a selection. 	|
| impactLight         	| Light. Provides a physical metaphor that complements the visual experience. For example, people might feel a thud when a view slides into place or two objects collide.                                                                                               |
| impactMedium        	| Medium. Provides a physical metaphor that complements the visual experience. For example, people might feel a thud when a view slides into place or two objects collide.                                               	                  	                  	    |
| impactHeavy         	| Heavy. Provides a physical metaphor that complements the visual experience. For example, people might feel a thud when a view slides into place or two objects collide.                                                                                              	|
| notificationSuccess 	| Success. Indicates that a task or action, such as depositing a check or unlocking a vehicle, has completed.                                                                                                                                                          	|
| notificationWarning 	| Warning. Indicates that a task or action, such as depositing a check or unlocking a vehicle, has produced a warning of some kind.                                                                                                                                    	|
| notificationError   	| Failure. Indicates that a task or action, such as depositing a check or unlocking a vehicle, has failed.                                                                                                                                                             	|
